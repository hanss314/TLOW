# Malcolm found this funny command on the interwebs, and used it
# 	because it said it would fix his computer problems
# It looks fine, then his computer gets really slow and freezes
# Sally just keeps hitting the side of the computer and praying
#	 to the linux gods
# She accidentally hits the power cord, now its fixed
# Sally & Malcolm  both learned that any problem can be fixed
#	 with percussive maintenance
