Tape of 9999 cells, initialized with 0, pointer starts at the 0th cell
R - Move the pointer to the right 1
L - Move the pointer to the left 1
P - Print the character represented by the cell at the pointer
N - Print the value of the cell at the pointer
A - Add the value at the cell immediately to the left of the pointer and the cell whose index is the value of the cell at the pointer
S - Subtract the value at the cell immediately to the left of the pointer and the cell whose index is the value of the cell at the pointer
M - Multiply the value at the cell immediately to the left of the pointer and the cell whose index is the value of the cell at the pointer
Q - Integer Divide the value at the cell immediately to the left of the pointer and the cell whose index is the value of the cell at the pointer
C - Copy the value of the cell whose index is the value of the cell at the pointer to the cell at the pointer
I - Increment the cell at the pointer
D - Decrement the cell at the pointer
J - Jump N instructions, where N is the value of the cell at the pointer
